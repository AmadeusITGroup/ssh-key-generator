## Will
* Extend the docs a bit more - contribution guide, code of conduct, how to setup your dev env and test the whole thing for potential contributors
* Offer the choice to change the type of key (currently statically bound to RSA)

* Parse all Include to get the full list of host to displayed in the quickpick box
